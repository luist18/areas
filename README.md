Microprocessors and Personal Computers ARM subroutine tester tool.

The MAST tool is originally a fork from [João Damas'](https://github.com/cyrilico) [Automatic Observation and (grade) Calculation for (subroutine) Operations tool](https://github.com/cyrilico/aoco-code-correction). It is a tool to automate student's grading in the assignments done during the Microprocessor and Personal Computers course unit.

## Differences with the original tool<!-- omit in toc -->

To ease the communication between the backend server and the tool the output demanded changes. Output `.txt` and `.csv` files are now combined in a more complete `.json` file. Structure of the `.zip` input file is simplified. Unsupported data types such as long and double are now supported. A new input parameter - weight - is introduced.

## 1. Installation

Using Docker:
```bash
$ docker pull luist188/mast-tool
```

## 2. Running

1. Place the input files inside any directory.
2. Run the image with a shared volume pointing to the input directory: `docker run -v input:destination -it luist188/mast-tool` (you can learn more about `docker run` usage [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/))
3. Run the alias command (assure you are using `/bin/bash`) `mast` or run `python main.py` in the tool's source.

```

## 4. File syntax and structure

### 4.1. Available data types

#### 4.1.1. Primitive data types

- `int`
- `long`
- `float`
- `double`
- `char`

#### 4.1.2. Array data types

- `char*/string`
- `array int`
- `array long`
- `array float`
- `array double`
- `array char`

### 4.2. subroutines.yaml

The input file for the subroutine declaration has to follow a specific structure and syntax described as follows:

```yaml
foo: 
  params: 
    - int
    - array char
    - array int
    - array int
  return: 
    - int
    - array int

bar: 
  params: 
    - long
  return: 
    - long
```

The subroutine name has to match the `.s` to test and is case insensitive. Thus, the subroutine `foo` or `bar` is going to check any `.s` file that matches its name case insensitive. All subroutines must contain an array of parameters, `params`, and an array of returns, `return`.

### 4.3. tests.yaml

The input file for the test cases declaration has to follow a specific structure and syntax described as follows:

```yaml
bar:
  - inputs:
    - 6
    outputs: 
    - 36
    weight: 0.5
  - inputs:
    - 5
    outputs: 
    - 25
    weight: 0.5
```

The root declaration of a test case must match the name declared in the `subroutines.yaml` file. Test cases have an array of inputs that has a list of outputs and a test weight. The sum of the test weights must be 1.0.

### 4.4. submission.zip

The submission `zip` file must contain a `.s` file in its root. For example, for the subroutine `foo` and `bar` the `zip` structure should be as follows:

```tree
submission.zip
├── foo.s
└── bar.s
```

## 5. Results

For each submission file a `.json` file is created in the feedback directory with the same name of the `.zip` file. The file contains all information about compilation status and test cases. In addition, a simplified version of the result of all submissions is created in a `result.json`. The content of the files look as follows:
